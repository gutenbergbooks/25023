<p class="center">THE GRIZZLY</p>


<p>NEARLY half a century has gone since I lived
among these scenes and made my observations
on the grand Old Bear of the Mountains.</p>

<p>Many new conditions have in that time developed,
have changed the course of history.
But the biggest, saddest change of all is that
the Grizzly Bear, the most magnificent, dignified,
and powerful beast of the wild, heroic
West, is gone.</p>

<p>There may be a few individuals about Yellowstone
Park or other great havens, but the
Grizzly Bear as the wide-wandering monarch
of the hills has gone the way of the Dodo.</p>

<p>It is just possible that in this last and latest
time a newborn strong and growing sentiment
will come to the rescue, will prompt us to seek
out and preserve the last remnant, just as long-belated
appreciation came at final stance to
save for later generations the Great Sequoia
Tree, when man's blind avarice had all but
wiped it out. Good men are now at work with
better thoughts, and reverence for the masterpieces,
the giants of creation's world. It may
be that this newer thought may come in force
and save the grand old Bear while yet it curbs
his power for harm. This is my hope and
prayer; this is the sentiment unwritten, but
expressed, in my Story of the Grizzly.</p>

<p><img class="initial" src="images/initial_h.png" alt="" title="" /><span class="smcap">e</span> was born over a
score of years ago,
away up in the wildest
part of the wild
West, on the head of
the Little Piney, above where the
Palette Ranch is now.</p>

<p>His Mother was just an ordinary
Silvertip, living the quiet life that
all Bears prefer, minding her own
business and doing her duty by her
family, asking no favors of any one
excepting to let her alone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<p>It was July before she took her
remarkable family down the Little
Piney to the Graybull, and showed
them what strawberries were, and
where to find them.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding their Mother's
deep conviction, the cubs were not
remarkably big or bright; yet they
were a remarkable family, for there
were four of them, and it is not
often a Grizzly Mother can boast
of more than two.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i012.png" width="600" height="198" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The woolly-coated little creatures
were having a fine time, and
reveled in the lovely mountain summer
and the abundance of good
things. Their Mother turned over
each log and flat stone they came
to, and the moment it was lifted
they all rushed under it like a lot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
of little pigs to lick up the ants and
grubs there hidden.</p>

<div>
<a name="image01" id="image01"></a>
</div>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<img src="images/image001.jpg" width="423" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption center">"THEY ALL RUSHED UNDER IT LIKE A LOT OF LITTLE PIGS."</p>
</div>

<p>It never once occurred to them
that Mammy's strength might fail
sometime, and let the great rock
drop just as they got under it; nor
would any one have thought so
that might have chanced to see
that huge arm and that shoulder
sliding about under the great yellow
robe she wore. No, no; that
arm could never fail. The little
ones were quite right. So they
hustled and tumbled one another
at each fresh log in their haste to
be first, and squealed little squeals,
and growled little growls, as if each
was a pig, a pup, and a kitten all
rolled into one.</p>

<p>They were well acquainted with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the common little brown ants that
harbor under logs in the uplands,
but now they came for the first time
on one of the hills of the great, fat,
luscious Wood-ant, and they all
crowded around to lick up those
that ran out. But they soon found
that they were licking up more cactus-prickles
and sand than ants, till
their Mother said in Grizzly, "Let
me show you how."</p>

<p>She knocked off the top of the
hill, then laid her great paw flat on
it for a few moments, and as the
angry ants swarmed on to it she
licked them up with one lick, and
got a good rich mouthful to crunch
without a grain of sand or a cactus-stinger
in it. The cubs soon learned.
Each put up both his little brown
paws, so that there was a ring of
paws all around the ant-hill, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
there they sat, like children playing
"hands," and each licked first the
right and then the left paw, or one
cuffed his brother's ears for licking
a paw that was not his own, till the
ant-hill was cleared out and they
were ready for a change.</p>

<p>Ants are sour food and made the
Bears thirsty, so the old one led
down to the river. After they had
drunk as much as they wanted, and
dabbled their feet, they walked
down the bank to a pool, where the
old one's keen eye caught sight of
a number of Buffalo-fish basking
on the bottom. The water was very
low, mere pebbly rapids between
these deep holes, so Mammy said
to the little ones:</p>

<p>"Now you all sit there on the
bank and learn something new."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i019.png" width="120" height="186" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>First she went to the lower end
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the pool and stirred up a cloud
of mud which hung in the still
water, and sent a long tail floating
like a curtain over the rapids just
below. Then she went quietly
round by land, and sprang into the
upper end of the pool with all the
noise she could. The fish had
crowded to that end, but this sudden
attack sent them off in a panic,
and they dashed blindly into the
mud-cloud. Out of fifty fish there
is always a good chance of some
being fools, and half a dozen of
these dashed through the darkened
water into the current, and before
they knew it they were struggling
over the shingly shallow. The old
Grizzly jerked them out to the
bank, and the little ones rushed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
noisily on these funny, short snakes
that could not get away, and gobbled
and gorged till their little
bellies looked like balloons.</p>

<p>They had eaten so much now,
and the sun was so hot, that all
were quite sleepy. So the Mother-bear
led them to a quiet little nook,
and as soon as she lay down, though
they were puffing with heat, they
all snuggled around her and went
to sleep, with their little brown paws
curled in, and their little black noses
tucked into their wool as though it
were a very cold day.</p>

<img class="plain" src="images/i022.png" width="100" height="360" alt="" title="" />
</div>


<p>After an hour or two they began
to yawn and stretch themselves,
except little Fuzz, the smallest;
she poked out her sharp nose for a
moment, then snuggled back between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
her Mother's great arms,
for she was a gentle, petted little
thing. The largest, the one afterward
known as Wahb, sprawled
over on his back and began to
worry a root that stuck up, grumbling
to himself as he chewed it,
or slapped it with his paw for not
staying where he wanted it. Presently
Mooney, the mischief, began
tugging at Frizzle's ears, and got
his own well boxed. They clenched
for a tussle; then, locked in a
tight, little grizzly yellow ball, they
sprawled over and over on the grass,
and, before they knew it, down a
bank, and away out of sight toward
the river.</p>

<p>Almost immediately there was
an outcry of yells for help from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
little wrestlers. There could be no
mistaking the real terror in their
voices. Some dreadful danger was
threatening.</p>

</div>

<p>Up jumped the gentle Mother,
changed into a perfect demon, and
over the bank in time to see a huge
Range-bull make a deadly charge
at what he doubtless took for a yellow
dog. In a moment all would
have been over with Frizzle, for he
had missed his footing on the bank;
but there was a thumping of heavy
feet, a roar that startled even the
great Bull, and, like a huge bounding
ball of yellow fur, Mother Grizzly
was upon him. Him! the monarch
of the herd, the master of all
these plains, what had he to fear?
He bellowed his deep war-cry, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
charged to pin the old one to the
bank; but as he bent to tear her
with his shining horns, she dealt
him a stunning blow, and before he
could recover she was on his shoulders,
raking the flesh from his ribs
with sweep after sweep of her terrific
claws.</p>

<p>The Bull roared with rage, and
plunged and reared, dragging
Mother Grizzly with him; then, as
he hurled heavily off the slope, she
let go to save herself, and the
Bull rolled down into the river.</p>

<p>This was a lucky thing for him,
for the Grizzly did not want to follow
him there; so he waded out on
the other side, and bellowing with
fury and pain, slunk off to join the
herd to which he belonged.</p>

<h3><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>II</h3>


<p><img class="initial" src="images/initial_o.png" alt="" title="" /><span class="smcap">ld</span> Colonel Pickett,
the cattle king, was
out riding the range.
The night before, he
had seen the new
moon descending over the white
cone of Pickett's Peak.</p>

<p>"I saw the last moon over Frank's
Peak," said he, "and the luck was
against me for a month; now I
reckon it's my turn."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 58px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i026.png" width="58" height="100" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Next morning his luck began.
A letter came from Washington
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
granting his request that a post-office
be established at his ranch,
and contained the polite inquiry,
"What name do you suggest for
the new post-office?"</p>

<p>The Colonel took down his new
rifle, a 45&ndash;90 repeater. "May as
well," he said; "this is my month";
and he rode up the Graybull to see
how the cattle were doing.</p>

<p>As he passed under the Rimrock
Mountain he heard a far-away roaring
as of Bulls fighting, but thought
nothing of it till he rounded the
point and saw on the flat below a
lot of his cattle pawing the dust and
bellowing as they always do when
they smell the blood of one of their
number. He soon saw that the
great Bull, "the boss of the bunch,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
was covered with blood. His back
and sides were torn as by a Mountain-lion,
and his head was battered
as by another Bull.</p>

<p>"Grizzly," growled the Colonel,
for he knew the mountains. He
quickly noted the general direction
of the Bull's back trail, then rode
toward a high bank that offered a
view. This was across the gravelly
ford of the Graybull, near the
mouth of the Piney. His horse
splashed through the cold water
and began jerkily to climb the other
bank.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i028.png" width="150" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>As soon as the rider's head rose
above the bank his hand grabbed
the rifle, for there in full sight were
five Grizzly Bears, an old one and
four cubs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
"Run for the woods," growled
the Mother Grizzly, for she knew
that men carried guns. Not that
she feared for herself; but the idea
of such things among her darlings
was too horrible to think of. She
set off to guide them to the timber-tangle
on the Lower Piney. But
an awful, murderous fusillade began.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> and Mother Grizzly felt
a deadly pang.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> and poor little Fuzz rolled
over with a scream of pain and lay
still.</p>

<p>With a roar of hate and fury
Mother Grizzly turned to attack
the enemy.</p>

<p><i>Bang!</i> and she fell paralyzed
and dying with a high shoulder
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
shot. And the three little cubs, not
knowing what to do, ran back to
their Mother.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i029.png" width="120" height="252" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Bang! bang!</i> and Mooney and
Frizzle sank in dying agonies beside
her, and Wahb, terrified and
stupefied, ran in a circle about
them. Then, hardly knowing why,
he turned and dashed into the timber-tangle,
and disappeared as a
last <i>bang</i> left him with a stinging
pain and a useless, broken hind
paw.</p>

<p>But away up in the woods of
Anderson's Peak that night a little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
lame Grizzly might have been seen
wandering, limping along, leaving
a bloody spot each time he tried
to set down his hind paw; whining
and whimpering, "Mother!
Mother! Oh, Mother, where are
you?" for he was cold and hungry,
and had such a pain in his foot.
But there was no Mother to come
to him, and he dared not go back
where he had left her, so he wandered
aimlessly about among the
pines.</p>

<p>Then he smelled some strange
animal smell and heard heavy footsteps;
and not knowing what else
to do, he climbed a tree. Presently
a band of great, long-necked, slim-legged
animals, taller than his
Mother, came by under the tree. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
had seen such once before and had
not been afraid of them then, because
he had been with his Mother.
But now he kept very quiet in the
tree, and the big creatures stopped
picking the grass when they were
near him, and blowing their noses,
ran out of sight.</p>

<p>He stayed in the tree till near
morning, and then he was so stiff
with cold that he could scarcely
get down. But the warm sun came
up, and he felt better as he sought
about for berries and ants, for he
was very hungry. Then he went
back to the Piney and put his
wounded foot in the ice-cold water.</p>

</div>

<p>He wanted to get back to the
mountains again, but still he felt he
must go to where he had left his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Mother and brothers. When the
afternoon grew warm, he went
limping down the stream through
the timber, and down on the banks
of the Graybull till he came to the
place where yesterday they had
had the fish-feast; and he eagerly
crunched the heads and remains
that he found. But there was an
odd and horrid smell on the wind.
It frightened him, and as he went
down to where he last had seen his
Mother the smell grew worse. He
peeped out cautiously at the place,
and saw there a lot of Coyotes, tearing
at something. What it was he
did not know; but he saw no
Mother, and the smell that sickened
and terrified him was worse than
ever, so he quietly turned back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
toward the timber-tangle of the
Lower Piney, and nevermore came
back to look for his lost family.
He wanted his Mother as much
as ever, but something told him it
was no use.</p>

<p>As cold night came down, he
missed her more and more again,
and he whimpered as he limped
along, a miserable, lonely, little,
motherless Bear&mdash;not lost in the
mountains, for he had no home to
seek, but so sick and lonely, and
with such a pain in his foot and in
his stomach a craving for the drink
that would nevermore be his. That
night he found a hollow log, and
crawling in, he tried to dream that
his Mother's great, furry arms were
around him, and he snuffled himself
to sleep.</p>

<p>It seemed as though every one
were against him. He tried to keep
out of sight in the upper woods of
the Piney, seeking his food by day
and resting at night in the hollow
log. But one evening he found it
occupied by a Porcupine as big as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
himself and as bad as a cactus-bush.
Wahb could do nothing with him.
He had to give up the log and seek
another nest.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i038.png" width="120" height="192" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>One day he went down on the
Graybull flat to dig some roots that
his Mother had taught him were
good. But before he had well begun,
a grayish-looking animal came
out of a hole in the ground and
rushed at him, hissing and growling.
Wahb did not know it was a
Badger, but he saw it was a fierce
animal as big as himself. He was
sick, and lame too, so he limped
away and never stopped till he was
on a ridge in the next ca&ntilde;on. Here
a Coyote saw him, and came bounding
after him, calling at the same
time to another to come and join
the fun. Wahb was near a tree, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
he scrambled up to the branches.
The Coyotes came bounding and
yelping below, but their noses told
them that this was a young Grizzly
they had chased, and they soon decided
that a young Grizzly in a tree
means a Mother Grizzly not far
away, and they had better let him
alone.</p>

<p>After they had sneaked off Wahb
came down and returned to the
Piney. There was better feeding
on the Graybull, but every one
seemed against him there now that
his loving guardian was gone, while
on the Piney he had peace at least
sometimes, and there were plenty
of trees that he could climb when
an enemy came.</p>

<p>His broken foot was a long time
in healing; indeed, it never got quite
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
well. The wound healed and the
soreness wore off, but it left a stiffness
that gave him a slight limp,
and the sole-balls grew together
quite unlike those of the other foot.
It particularly annoyed him when
he had to climb a tree or run fast
from his enemies; and of them he
found no end, though never once
did a friend cross his path. When
he lost his Mother he lost his best
and only friend. She would have
taught him much that he had to
learn by bitter experience, and
would have saved him from most
of the ills that befell him in his
cubhood&mdash;ills so many and so dire
that but for his native sturdiness
he never could have passed through
alive.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i040.png" width="450" height="60" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The pi&ntilde;ons bore plentifully that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
year, and the winds began to shower
down the ripe, rich nuts. Life
was becoming a little easier for
Wahb. He was gaining in health
and strength, and the creatures he
daily met now let him alone. But
as he feasted on the pi&ntilde;ons one
morning after a gale, a great Blackbear
came marching down the hill.
"No one meets a friend in the
woods," was a byword that Wahb
had learned already. He swung up
the nearest tree. At first the Blackbear
was scared, for he smelled the
smell of Grizzly; but when he saw
it was only a cub, he took courage
and came growling at Wahb. He
could climb as well as the little
Grizzly, or better, and high as
Wahb went, the Blackbear followed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and when Wahb got out on
the smallest and highest twig that
would carry him, the Blackbear
cruelly shook him off, so that he
was thrown to the ground, bruised
and shaken and half-stunned. He
limped away moaning, and the only
thing that kept the Blackbear from
following him up and perhaps killing
him was the fear that the old
Grizzly might be about. So Wahb
was driven away down the creek
from all the good pi&ntilde;on woods.</p>

<p>There was not much food on the
Graybull now. The berries were
nearly all gone; there were no fish
or ants to get, and Wahb, hurt,
lonely, and miserable, wandered
on and on, till he was away down
toward the Meteetsee.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
A Coyote came bounding and
barking through the sage-brush
after him. Wahb tried to run, but
it was no use; the Coyote was soon
up with him. Then with a sudden
rush of desperate courage Wahb
turned and charged his foe. The
astonished Coyote gave a scared
yowl or two, and fled with his tail
between his legs. Thus Wahb
learned that war is the price of
peace.</p>

<p>But the forage was poor here;
there were too many cattle; and
Wahb was making for a far-away
pi&ntilde;on woods in the Meteetsee
Ca&ntilde;on when he saw a man, just
like the one he had seen on that
day of sorrow. At the same moment
he heard a <i>bang</i>, and some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
sage-brush rattled and fell just
over his back. All the dreadful
smells and dangers of that day
came back to his memory, and
Wahb ran as he never had run before.</p>

<p>He soon got into a gully and followed
it into the ca&ntilde;on. An opening
between two cliffs seemed to
offer shelter, but as he ran toward
it a Range-cow came trotting between,
shaking her head at him and
snorting threats against his life.</p>

<p>He leaped aside upon a long log
that led up a bank, but at once a
savage Bobcat appeared on the
other end and warned him to go
back. It was no time to quarrel.
Bitterly Wahb felt that the world
was full of enemies. But he turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
and scrambled up a rocky bank
into the pi&ntilde;on woods that border
the benches of the Meteetsee.</p>

<p class="caption center">"A SAVAGE BOBCAT ... WARNED HIM TO GO BACK."</p>
</div>

<p>The Pine Squirrels seemed to
resent his coming, and barked furiously.
They were thinking about
their pi&ntilde;on-nuts. They knew that
this Bear was coming to steal their
provisions, and they followed him
overhead to scold and abuse him,
with such an outcry that an enemy
might have followed him by their
noise, which was exactly what they
intended.</p>

<p>There was no one following, but
it made Wahb uneasy and nervous.
So he kept on till he reached the
timber line, where both food and
foes were scarce, and here on the
edge of the Mountain-sheep land
at last he got a chance to rest.</p>

<p><img class="initial" src="images/initial_w.png" alt="" title="" /><span class="smcap">ahb</span> never was
sweet-tempered like
his baby sister, and
the persecutions by
his numerous foes
were making him more and more
sour. Why could not they let him
alone in his misery? Why was
every one against him? If only
he had his Mother back! If he
could only have killed that Blackbear
that had driven him from his
woods! It did not occur to him
that some day he himself would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
big. And that spiteful Bobcat, that
took advantage of him; and the
man that had tried to kill him. He
did not forget any of them, and
he hated them all.</p>

<p>Wahb found his new range fairly
good, because it was a good nut
year. He learned just what the
Squirrels feared he would, for his
nose directed him to the little granaries
where they had stored up
great quantities of nuts for winter's
use. It was hard on the Squirrels,
but it was good luck for Wahb, for
the nuts were delicious food. And
when the days shortened and the
nights began to be frosty, he had
grown fat and well-favored.</p>

<p>He traveled over all parts of the
ca&ntilde;on now, living mostly in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
higher woods, but coming down at
times to forage almost as far as the
river. One night as he wandered
by the deep water a peculiar smell
reached his nose. It was quite
pleasant, so he followed it up to the
water's edge. It seemed to come
from a sunken log. As he reached
over toward this, there was a sudden
<i>clank</i>, and one of his paws was
caught in a strong, steel Beaver-trap.</p>

<div>
<a name="image05" id="image05"></a>

<p class="caption center">"WAHB YELLED AND JERKED BACK."</p>
</div>

<p>Wahb yelled and jerked back
with all his strength, and tore up
the stake that held the trap. He
tried to shake it off, then ran away
through the bushes trailing it. He
tore at it with his teeth; but there
it hung, quiet, cold, strong, and immovable.
Every little while he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
tore at it with his teeth and claws,
or beat it against the ground. He
buried it in the earth, then climbed
a low tree, hoping to leave it behind;
but still it clung, biting into
his flesh. He made for his own
woods, and sat down to try to
puzzle it out. He did not know
what it was, but his little green-brown
eyes glared with a mixture
of pain, fright, and fury as he tried
to understand his new enemy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i052.png" width="100" height="140" alt="" title="" />

<img class="plain" src="images/i053.png" width="160" height="133" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He lay down under the bushes,
and, intent on deliberately crushing
the thing, he held it down with one
paw while he tightened his teeth
on the other end, and bearing down
as it slid away, the trap jaws opened
and the foot was free. It was mere
chance, of course, that led him to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
squeeze both springs at once. He
did not understand it, but he did
not forget it, and he got these not
very clear ideas: "There is a dreadful
little enemy that hides by the
water and waits for one. It has an
odd smell. It bites one's paws and
is too hard for one to bite. But it
can be got off by hard squeezing."</p>

<p>For a week or more the little
Grizzly had another sore paw, but
it was not very bad if he did not do
any climbing.</p>

<p>It was now the season when the
Elk were bugling on the mountains.
Wahb heard them all night, and
once or twice had to climb to get
away from one of the big-antlered
Bulls. It was also the season when
the trappers were coming into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
mountains, and the Wild Geese
were honking overhead. There
were several quite new smells in
the woods, too. Wahb followed
one of these up, and it led to a
place where were some small logs
piled together; then, mixed with
the smell that had drawn him, was
one that he hated&mdash;he remembered
it from the time when he had
lost his Mother. He sniffed about
carefully, for it was not very strong,
and learned that this hateful smell
was on a log in front, and the
sweet smell that made his mouth
water was under some brush behind.
So he went around, pulled
away the brush till he got the prize,
a piece of meat, and as he grabbed
it, the log in front went down with
a heavy <i>chock</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
It made Wahb jump; but he got
away all right with the meat and
some new ideas, and with one old
idea made stronger, and that was,
"When that hateful smell is around
it always means trouble."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p>As the weather grew colder,
Wahb became very sleepy; he
slept all day when it was frosty. He
had not any fixed place to sleep in;
he knew a number of dry ledges
for sunny weather, and one or two
sheltered nooks for stormy days.
He had a very comfortable nest under
a root, and one day, as it began
to blow and snow, he crawled into
this and curled up to sleep. The
storm howled without. The snow
fell deeper and deeper. It draped
the pine-trees till they bowed, then
shook themselves clear to be draped
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
anew. It drifted over the mountains
and poured down the funnel-like
ravines, blowing off the peaks
and ridges, and filling up the hollows
level with their rims. It piled
up over Wahb's den, shutting out
the cold of the winter, shutting out
itself: and Wahb slept and slept.</p>

waking, for such
is the way of Bears,
and yet when spring
came and aroused
him, he knew that he had been
asleep a long time. He was not
much changed&mdash;he had grown in
height, and yet was but little thinner.
He was now very hungry, and
forcing his way through the deep
drift that still lay over his den, he
set out to look for food.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
There were no pi&ntilde;on-nuts to get,
and no berries or ants; but Wahb's
nose led him away up the ca&ntilde;on to
the body of a winter-killed Elk,
where he had a fine feast, and then
buried the rest for future use.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 85px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i058.png" width="85" height="400" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Day after day he came back till
he had finished it. Food was very
scarce for a couple of months, and
after the Elk was eaten, Wahb lost
all the fat he had when he awoke.
One day he climbed over the Divide
into the Warhouse Valley. It
was warm and sunny there, vegetation
was well advanced, and he
found good forage. He wandered
down toward the thick timber, and
soon smelled the smell of another
Grizzly. This grew stronger and
led him to a single tree by a Bear-trail.
Wahb reared up on his hind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
feet to smell this tree. It was strong
of Bear, and was plastered with
mud and Grizzly hair far higher
than he could reach; and Wahb
knew that it must have been a very
large Bear that had rubbed himself
there. He felt uneasy. He
used to long to meet one of his own
kind, yet now that there was a
chance of it he was filled with
dread.</p>

<p>No one had shown him anything
but hatred in his lonely, unprotected
life, and he could not tell what this
older Bear might do. As he stood
in doubt, he caught sight of the old
Grizzly himself slouching along a
hillside, stopping from time to time
to dig up the quamash-roots and
wild turnips.</p>

<p>He was a monster. Wahb instinctively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
distrusted him, and sneaked
away through the woods and up a
rocky bluff where he could watch.</p>

<p>Then the big fellow came on
Wahb's track and rumbled a deep
growl of anger; he followed the
trail to the tree, and rearing up, he
tore the bark with his claws, far
above where Wahb had reached.
Then he strode rapidly along
Wahb's trail. But the cub had seen
enough. He fled back over the Divide
into the Meteetsee Ca&ntilde;on, and
realized in his dim, bearish way
that he was at peace there because
the Bear-forage was so poor.</p>

<p>As the summer came on, his
coat was shed. His skin got very
itchy, and he found pleasure in
rolling in the mud and scraping his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
back against some convenient tree.
He never climbed now: his claws
were too long, and his arms, though
growing big and strong, were losing
that suppleness of wrist that makes
cub Grizzlies and all Blackbears
great climbers. He now dropped
naturally into the Bear habit of
seeing how high he could reach
with his nose on the rubbing-post,
whenever he was near one.</p>

</div>

<p>He may not have noticed it, yet
each time he came to a post, after
a week or two away, he could reach
higher, for Wahb was growing fast
and coming into his strength.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was at one end of
the country that he felt was his,
and sometimes at another, but he
had frequent use for the rubbing-tree,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and thus it was that his range
was mapped out by posts with his
own mark on them.</p>

<p>One day late in summer he
sighted a stranger on his land, a
glossy Blackbear, and he felt furious
against the interloper. As the
Blackbear came nearer Wahb noticed
the tan-red face, the white
spot on his breast, and then the bit
out of his ear, and last of all the
wind brought a whiff. There could
be no further doubt it was the very
smell: this was the black coward
that had chased him down the
Piney long ago. But how he had
shrunken! Before, he had looked
like a giant; now Wahb felt he
could crush him with one paw. Revenge
is sweet, Wahb felt, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
he did not exactly say it, and he
went for that red-nosed Bear. But
the Black one went up a small tree
like a Squirrel. Wahb tried to follow
as the other once followed
him, but somehow he could not.
He did not seem to know how to
take hold now, and after a while he
gave it up and went away, although
the Blackbear brought him back
more than once by coughing in derision.
Later on that day, when
the Grizzly passed again, the red-nosed
one had gone.</p>

<p>As the summer waned, the upper
forage-grounds began to give
out, and Wahb ventured down to
the Lower Meteetsee one night to
explore. There was a pleasant
odor on the breeze, and following
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
it up, Wahb came to the carcass
of a Steer. A good distance away
from it were some tiny Coyotes,
mere dwarfs compared with those
he remembered. Right by the carcass
was another that jumped
about in the moonlight in a foolish
way. For some strange reason
it seemed unable to get away.
Wahb's old hatred broke out. He
rushed up. In a flash the Coyote
bit him several times before, with
one blow of that great paw, Wahb
smashed him into a limp, furry rag;
then broke in all his ribs with a
crunch or two of his jaws. Oh,
but it was good to feel the hot,
bloody juices oozing between his
teeth!</p>

<p>The Coyote was caught in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
trap. Wahb hated the smell of the
iron, so he went to the other side
of the carcass, where it was not so
strong, and had eaten but little before
<i>clank</i>, and his foot was caught
in a Wolf-trap that he had not seen.</p>

<p>But he remembered that he had
once before been caught and had
escaped by squeezing the trap.
He set a hind foot on each spring
and pressed till the trap opened
and released his paw. About the
carcass was the smell that he knew
stood for man, so he left it and wandered
down-stream; but more and
more often he got whiffs of that horrible
odor, so he turned and went
back to his quiet pi&ntilde;on benches.</p>

<p><img class="initial" src="images/initial_w.png" alt="" title="" /><span class="smcap">ahb's</span> third summer
had brought
him the stature of
a large-sized Bear,
though not nearly
the bulk and power that in time
were his. He was very light-colored
now, and this was why Spahwat,
a Shoshone Indian who more
than once hunted him, called him
the Whitebear, or Wahb.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">

<img class="plain" src="images/i072.png" width="120" height="200" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Spahwat was a good hunter, and
as soon as he saw the rubbing-tree
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
on the Upper Meteetsee he knew
that he was on the range of a big
Grizzly. He bushwhacked the
whole valley, and spent many days
before he found a chance to shoot;
then Wahb got a stinging flesh-wound
in the shoulder. He growled
horribly, but it had seemed to take
the fight out of him; he scrambled
up the valley and over the lower
hills till he reached a quiet haunt,
where he lay down.</p>

<p>His knowledge of healing was
wholly instinctive. He licked the
wound and all around it, and sought
to be quiet. The licking removed
the dirt, and by massage reduced
the inflammation, and it plastered
the hair down as a sort of dressing
over the wound to keep out the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
air, dirt, and microbes. There
could be no better treatment.</p>

<p class="caption center">"HE STRUCK ONE FEARFUL, CRUSHING BLOW."</p>
</div>

<p>But the Indian was on his trail.
Before long the smell warned Wahb
that a foe was coming, so he quietly
climbed farther up the mountain
to another resting-place. But
again he sensed the Indian's approach,
and made off. Several
times this happened, and at length
there was a second shot and another
galling wound. Wahb was
furious now. There was nothing
that really frightened him but that
horrible odor of man, iron, and guns,
that he remembered from the day
when he lost his Mother; but now
all fear of these left him. He
heaved painfully up the mountain
again, and along under a six-foot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
ledge, then up and back to the top
of the bank, where he lay flat. On
came the Indian, armed with knife
and gun; deftly, swiftly keeping on
the trail; gloating joyfully over each
bloody print that meant such anguish
to the hunted Bear. Straight
up the slide of broken rock he
came, where Wahb, ferocious with
pain, was waiting on the ledge. On
sneaked the dogged hunter; his
eye still scanned the bloody slots
or swept the woods ahead, but
never was raised to glance above
the ledge. And Wahb, as he saw
this shape of Death relentless on
his track, and smelled the hated
smell, poised his bulk at heavy
cost upon his quivering, mangled
arm, there held until the proper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
instant came, then to his sound
arm's matchless native force he
added all the weight of desperate
hate as down he struck one fearful,
crushing blow. The Indian sank
without a cry, and then dropped
out of sight. Wahb rose, and
sought again a quiet nook where
he might nurse his wounds. Thus
he learned that one must fight for
peace; for he never saw that Indian
again, and he had time to rest
and recover.</p>

before, except that
each winter Wahb
slept less soundly,
and each spring he
came out earlier and was a bigger
Grizzly, with fewer enemies that
dared to face him. When his sixth
year came he was a very big, strong,
sullen Bear, with neither friendship
nor love in his life since that
evil day on the Lower Piney.</p>

</div>

<p>No one ever heard of Wahb's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
mate. No one believes that he ever
had one. The love-season of Bears
came and went year after year, but
left him alone in his prime as he
had been in his youth. It is not
good for a Bear to be alone; it is
bad for him in every way. His habitual
moroseness grew with his
strength, and any one chancing to
meet him now would have called
him a dangerous Grizzly.</p>

<p>He had lived in the Meteetsee
Valley since first he betook himself
there, and his character had
been shaped by many little adventures
with traps and his wild rivals
of the mountains. But there was
none of the latter that he now feared
and he knew enough to avoid the
first, for that penetrating odor of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
man and iron was a never-failing
warning, especially after an experience
which befell him in his sixth
year.</p>

<p>His ever-reliable nose told him
that there was a dead Elk down
among the timber.</p>

<p>He went up the wind, and there,
sure enough, was the great delicious
carcass, already torn open
at the very best place. True, there
was that terrible man-and-iron
taint, but it was so slight and the
feast so tempting that after circling
around and inspecting the carcass
from his eight feet of stature, as he
stood erect, he went cautiously forward,
and at once was caught by
his left paw in an enormous Bear-trap.
He roared with pain and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
slashed about in a fury. But this
was no Beaver-trap; it was a big
forty-pound Bear-catcher, and he
was surely caught.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i080.png" width="160" height="283" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Wahb fairly foamed with rage,
and madly grit his teeth upon the
trap. Then he remembered his
former experiences. He placed the
trap between his hind legs, with a
hind paw on each spring, and
pressed down with all his weight.
But it was not enough. He dragged
off the trap and its clog, and went
clanking up the mountain. Again
and again he tried to free his foot,
but in vain, till he came where a
great trunk crossed the trail a few
feet from the ground. By chance,
or happy thought, he reared again
under this and made a new attempt.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
With a hind foot on each spring
and his mighty shoulders underneath
the tree, he bore down
with his titanic strength: the great
steel springs gave way, the jaws
relaxed, and he tore out his foot.
So Wahb was free again, though
he left behind a great toe which
had been nearly severed by the
first snap of the steel.</p>

<p>Again Wahb had a painful wound
to nurse, and as he was a left-handed
Bear,&mdash;that is, when he
wished to turn a rock over he stood
on the right paw and turned with
the left,&mdash;one result of this disablement
was to rob him for a time
of all those dainty foods that are
found under rocks or logs. The
wound healed at last, but he never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
forgot that experience, and thenceforth
the pungent smell of man and
iron, even without the gun smell,
never failed to enrage him.</p>

<p>Many experiences had taught
him that it is better to run if he
only smelled the hunter or heard
him far away, but to fight desperately
if the man was close at hand.
And the cow-boys soon came to
know that the Upper Meteetsee
was the range of a Bear that was
better let alone.</p>

into the lower part

to his surprise one
of the wooden dens that men make
for themselves. As he came around
to get the wind, he sensed the taint
that never failed to infuriate him
now, and a moment later he heard
a loud <i>bang</i> and felt a stinging shock
in his left hind leg, the old stiff leg.
He wheeled about, in time to see a
man running toward the new-made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
shanty. Had the shot been in his
shoulder Wahb would have been
helpless, but it was not.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 3em"><span class="smcap">Mighty</span> arms that could toss pine

tried to take the Bear's life, and
had lost his own. But Jack's partner
swore he would kill that Bear.</p>

<p>He took up the trail and followed
it up the ca&ntilde;on, and there bushwhacked
and hunted day after day.
He put out baits and traps, and at
length one day he heard a <i>crash</i>,
<i>clatter</i>, <i>thump</i>, and a huge rock
bounded down a bank into a wood,
scaring out a couple of deer that
floated away like thistle-down.
Miller thought at first that it was a
land-slide; but he soon knew that
it was Wahb that had rolled the
boulder over merely for the sake
of two or three ants beneath it.</p>

<p>The wind had not betrayed him,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
so on peering through the bush
Miller saw the great Bear as he
fed, favoring his left hind leg and
growling sullenly to himself at a
fresh twinge of pain. Miller steadied
himself, and thought, "Here
goes a finisher or a dead miss."
He gave a sharp whistle, the Bear
stopped every move, and, as he
stood with ears acock, the man
fired at his head.</p>

<p>But at that moment the great
shaggy head moved, only an infuriating
scratch was given, the smoke
betrayed the man's place, and the
Grizzly made savage, three-legged
haste to catch his foe.</p>

<p>Miller dropped his gun and
swung lightly into a tree, the only
large one near. Wahb raged in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
vain against the trunk. He tore
off the bark with his teeth and
claws; but Miller was safe beyond
his reach. For fully four hours the
Grizzly watched, then gave it up,
and slowly went off into the bushes
till lost to view. Miller watched
him from the tree, and afterward
waited nearly an hour to be sure
that the Bear was gone. He then
slipped to the ground, got his gun,
and set out for camp. But Wahb
was cunning; he had only <i>seemed</i>
to go away, and then had sneaked
back quietly to watch. As soon as
the man was away from the tree,
too far to return, Wahb dashed
after him. In spite of his wounds
the Bear could move the faster.
Within a quarter of a mile&mdash;well,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
Wahb did just what the man had
sworn to do to him.</p>

<p>Long afterward his friends found
the gun and enough to tell the tale.</p>

<p>The claim-shanty on the Meteetsee
fell to pieces. It never
again was used, for no man cared
to enter a country that had but few
allurements to offset its evident
curse of ill luck, and where such a
terrible Grizzly was always on the
war-path.</p>

good gold on the
Upper Meteetsee.
Miners came in
pairs and wandered
through the peaks, rooting up
the ground and spoiling the little
streams&mdash;grizzly old men mostly,
that had lived their lives in the
mountain and were themselves
slowly turning into Grizzly Bears;
digging and grubbing everywhere,
not for good, wholesome roots, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
for that shiny yellow sand that they
could not eat; living the lives of
Grizzlies, asking nothing but to be
let alone to dig.</p>

<p>They seemed to understand
Grizzly Wahb. The first time they
met, Wahb reared up on his hind
legs, and the wicked green lightnings
began to twinkle in his small
eyes. The elder man said to his
mate:</p>

<p>"Let him alone, and he won't
bother you."</p>

<p>"Ain't he an awful size, though?"
replied the other, nervously.</p>

<p>Wahb was about to charge, but
something held him back&mdash;a something
that had no reference to his
senses, that was felt only when
they were still; a something that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
in Bear and Man is wiser than his
wisdom, and that points the way
at every doubtful fork in the dim
and winding trail.</p>

<p>Of course Wahb did not understand
what the men said, but he
did feel that there was something
different here. The smell of man
and iron was there, but not of that
maddening kind, and he missed
the pungent odor that even yet
brought back the dark days of his
cubhood.</p>

<p>The men did not move, so Wahb
rumbled a subterranean growl,
dropped down on his four feet, and
went on.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i093.png" width="100" height="183" alt="" title="" />

<p>Late the same year Wahb ran
across the red-nosed Blackbear.
How that Bear did keep on shrinking!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Wahb could have hurled him
across the Graybull with one tap
now.</p>

<p>But the Blackbear did not mean
to let him try. He hustled his fat,
podgy body up a tree at a rate that
made him puff. Wahb reached up
nine feet from the ground, and with
one rake of his huge claws tore
off the bark clear to the shining
white wood and down nearly to
the ground; and the Blackbear
shivered and whimpered with terror
as the scraping of those awful
claws ran up the trunk and up his
spine in a way that was horribly
suggestive.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i094.png" width="80" height="415" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>What was it that the sight of
that Blackbear stirred in Wahb?
Was it memories of the Upper
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Piney, long forgotten; thoughts of
a woodland rich in food?</p>

<p>Wahb left him trembling up there
as high as he could get, and without
any very clear purpose swung
along the upper benches of the
Meteetsee down to the Graybull,
around the foot of the Rimrock
Mountain; on, till hours later he
found himself in the timber-tangle
of the Lower Piney, and among
the berries and ants of the old
times.</p>

<p>He had forgotten what a fine
land the Piney was: plenty of food,
no miners to spoil the streams, no
hunters to keep an eye on, and no
mosquitoes or flies, but plenty of
open, sunny glades and sheltering
woods, backed up by high, straight
cliffs to turn the colder winds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
There were, moreover, no resident
Grizzlies, no signs even of
passing travelers, and the Blackbears
that were in possession did
not count.</p>

<p>Wahb was well pleased. He
rolled his vast bulk in an old Buffalo-wallow,
and rearing up against
a tree where the Piney Ca&ntilde;on quits
the Graybull Ca&ntilde;on, he left on it
his mark fully eight feet from the
ground.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i096.png" width="120" height="120" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In the days that followed he
wandered farther and farther up
among the rugged spurs of the
Shoshones, and took possession
as he went. He found the sign-boards
of several Blackbears, and
if they were small dead trees he
sent them crashing to earth with a
drive of his giant paw. If they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
were green, he put his own mark
over the other mark, and made it
clearer by slashing the bark with
the great pickaxes that grew on
his toes.</p>

<p>The Upper Piney had so long
been a Blackbear range that the
Squirrels had ceased storing their
harvest in hollow trees, and were
now using the spaces under flat
rocks, where the Blackbears could
not get at them; so Wahb found
this a land of plenty: every fourth
or fifth rock in the pine woods was
the roof of a Squirrel or Chipmunk
granary, and when he turned
it over, if the little owner were
there, Wahb did not scruple to
flatten him with his paw and devour
him as an agreeable relish to
his own provisions.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
And wherever Wahb went he
put up his sign-board:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">Trespassers beware!</p>
</div>

<p>It was written on the trees as
high up as he could reach, and
every one that came by understood
that the scent of it and the hair in
it were those of the great Grizzly
Wahb.</p>

<p>If his Mother had lived to train
him, Wahb would have known that
a good range in spring may be a
bad one in summer. Wahb found
out by years of experience that a
total change with the seasons is
best. In the early spring the Cattle
and Elk ranges, with their winter-killed
carcasses, offer a bountiful
feast. In early summer the
best forage is on the warm hillsides
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
where the quamash and the
Indian turnip grow. In late summer
the berry-bushes along the
river-flat are laden with fruit, and
in autumn the pine woods gave
good chances to fatten for the winter.
So he added to his range each
year. He not only cleared out the
Blackbears from the Piney and the
Meteetsee, but he went over the
Divide and killed that old fellow
that had once chased him out of
the Warhouse Valley. And, more
than that, he held what he had
won, for he broke up a camp of
tenderfeet that were looking for a
ranch location on the Middle Meteetsee;
he stampeded their horses,
and made general smash of the
camp. And so all the animals, including
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
man, came to know that
the whole range from Frank's Peak
to the Shoshone spurs was the proper
domain of a king well able to
defend it, and the name of that king
was Meteetsee Wahb.</p>

<p>Any creature whose strength
puts him beyond danger of open
attack is apt to lose in cunning.
Yet Wahb never forgot his early
experience with the traps. He
made it a rule never to go near that
smell of man and iron, and that
was the reason that he never again
was caught.</p>

<p>So he led his lonely life and
slouched around on the mountains,
throwing boulders about like pebbles,
and huge trunks like matchwood,
as he sought for his daily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
food. And every beast of hill and
plain soon came to know and fly in
fear of Wahb, the one time hunted,
persecuted Cub. And more than
one Blackbear paid with his life for
the ill-deed of that other, long ago.
And many a cranky Bobcat flying
before him took to a tree, and if
that tree were dead and dry, Wahb
heaved it down, and tree and Cat
alike were dashed to bits. Even
the proud-necked Stallion, leader
of the mustang band, thought well
for once to yield the road. The
great, grey Timberwolves, and the
Mountain Lions too, left their new
kill and sneaked in sullen fear aside
when Wahb appeared. And if, as
he hulked across the sage-covered
river-flat sending the scared Antelope
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
skimming like birds before
him, he was faced perchance, by
some burly Range-bull, too young
to be wise and too big to be afraid,
Wahb smashed his skull with one
blow of that giant paw, and served
him as the Range-cow would have
served himself long years ago.</p>

<p>The All-mother never fails to
offer to her own, twin cups, one
gall, and one of balm. Little or
much they may drink, but equally
of each. The mountain that is
easy to descend must soon be
climbed again. The grinding hardship
of Wahb's early days had
built his mighty frame. All usual
pleasures of a grizzly's life had
been denied him but <i>power</i> bestowed
in more than double share.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
So he lived on year after year,
unsoftened by mate or companion,
sullen, fearing nothing, ready
to fight, but asking only to be let
alone&mdash;quite alone. He had but
one keen pleasure in his sombre
life&mdash;the lasting glory in his matchless
strength&mdash;the small but never
failing thrill of joy as the foe fell
crushed and limp, or the riven
boulders grit and heaved when he
turned on them the measure of his
wondrous force.</p>

<p><img class="initial" src="images/initial_e.png" alt="" title="" /><span class="smcap">verything</span> has
a smell of its own
for those that have
noses to smell. Wahb
had been learning
smells all his life, and knew the
meaning of most of those in the
mountains. It was as though each
and every thing had a voice of its
own for him; and yet it was far
better than a voice, for every one
knows that a good nose is better
than eyes and ears together. And
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
each of these myriads of voices
kept on crying, "Here and such
am I."</p>

<p>The juniper-berries, the rosehips,
the strawberries, each had a
soft, sweet little voice, calling,
"Here we are&mdash;Berries, Berries."</p>

<p>The great pine woods had a
loud, far-reaching voice, "Here
are we, the Pine-trees," but when
he got right up to them Wahb
could hear the low, sweet call of
the pi&ntilde;on-nuts, "Here are we, the
Pi&ntilde;on-nuts."</p>

<p>And the quamash beds in May
sang a perfect chorus when the
wind was right: "Quamash beds,
Quamash beds."</p>

<p>And when he got among them
he made out each single voice.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Each root had its own little piece
to say to his nose: "Here am I, a
big Quamash, rich and ripe," or
a tiny, sharp voice, "Here am I,
a good-for-nothing, stringy little
root."</p>

<p>And the broad, rich russulas in
the autumn called aloud, "I am a
fat, wholesome Mushroom," and
the deadly amanita cried, "I am an
Amanita. Let me alone, or you'll
be a sick Bear." And the fairy
harebell of the ca&ntilde;on-banks sang
a song too, as fine as its thread-like
stem, and as soft as its dainty
blue; but the warden of the smells
had learned to report it not, for
this, and a million other such, were
of no interest to Wahb.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i107.png" width="400" height="233" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>So every living thing that moved,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
and every flower that grew, and
every rock and stone and shape
on earth told out its tale and sang
its little story to his nose. Day or
night, fog or bright, that great,
moist nose told him most of the
things he needed to know, or
passed unnoticed those of no concern,
and he depended on it more
and more. If his eyes and ears together
reported so and so, he would
not even then believe it until his
nose said, "Yes; that is right."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i108.png" width="120" height="112" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But this is something that man
cannot understand, for he has sold
the birthright of his nose for the
privilege of living in towns.</p>

<p>While hundreds of smells were
agreeable to Wahb, thousands
were indifferent to him, a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
many were unpleasant, and some
actually put him in a rage.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 3em">He had often noticed that if a
west wind were blowing when he
was at the head of the Piney
Ca&ntilde;on there was an odd, new
scent. Some days he did not mind
it, and some days it disgusted
him; but he never followed it up.
On other days a north wind from
the high Divide brought a most
awful smell, something unlike any
other, a smell that he wanted only
to get away from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wahb</span> was getting well past his
youth now, and he began to have
pains in the hind leg that had been
wounded so often. After a cold
night or a long time of wet weather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
he could scarcely use that leg, and
one day, while thus crippled, the
west wind came down the ca&ntilde;on
with an odd message to his nose.
Wahb could not clearly read the
message, but it seemed to say,
"Come," and something within him
said, "Go." The smell of food will
draw a hungry creature and disgust
a gorged one. We do not know
why, and all that any one can learn
is that the desire springs from a
need of the body. So Wahb felt
drawn by what had long disgusted
him, and he slouched up the mountain
path, grumbling to himself and
slapping savagely back at branches
that chanced to switch his face.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i111.png" width="100" height="77" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The odd odor grew very strong;
it led him where he had never been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
before&mdash;up a bank of whitish sand
to a bench of the same color, where
there was unhealthy-looking water
running down, and a kind of fog
coming out of a hole. Wahb threw
up his nose suspiciously&mdash;such a
peculiar smell! He climbed the
bench.</p>

<p>A snake wriggled across the
sand in front. Wahb crushed it
with a blow that made the near
trees shiver and sent a balanced
boulder toppling down, and he
growled a growl that rumbled up
the valley like distant thunder.
Then he came to the foggy hole.
It was full of water that moved
gently and steamed. Wahb put in
his foot, and found it was quite
warm and that it felt pleasantly on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
his skin. He put in both feet, and
little by little went in farther, causing
the pool to overflow on all
sides, till he was lying at full length
in the warm, almost hot, sulphur-spring,
and sweltering in the greenish
water, while the wind drifted
the steam about overhead.</p>

<p>There are plenty of these sulphur-springs
in the Rockies, but
this chanced to be the only one on
Wahb's range. He lay in it for
over an hour; then, feeling that he
had had enough, he heaved his
huge bulk up on the bank, and
realized that he was feeling remarkably
well and supple. The
stiffness of his hind leg was gone.</p>

<p>He shook the water from his
shaggy coat. A broad ledge in full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
sun-heat invited him to stretch
himself out and dry. But first he
reared against the nearest tree and
left a mark that none could mistake.
True, there were plenty of
signs of other animals using the
sulphur-bath for their ills; but
what of it? Thenceforth that tree
bore this inscription, in a language
of mud, hair, and smell, that every
mountain creature could read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center" style="margin-bottom: 0em">My bath. Keep away!</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 0em">(Signed) WAHB</p>
</div>

<p>Wahb lay on his belly till his
back was dry, then turned on his
broad back and squirmed about in
a ponderous way till the broiling
sun had wholly dried him. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
realized that he was really feeling
very well now. He did not say to
himself, "I am troubled with that
unpleasant disease called rheumatism,
and sulphur-bath treatment
is the thing to cure it." But what
he did know was, "I have dreadful
pains; I feel better when I am in
this stinking pool." So thenceforth
he came back whenever the pains
began again, and each time he was
cured.</p>

Wahb grew no bigger,&mdash;there
was no
need for that,&mdash;but
he got whiter, crosser,
and more dangerous. He really had
an enormous range now. Each
spring, after the winter storms
had removed his notice-boards, he
went around and renewed them.
It was natural to do so, for, first of
all, the scarcity of food compelled
him to travel all over the range.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
There were lots of clay wallows at
that season, and the itching of his
skin, as the winter coat began to
shed, made the dressing of cool,
wet clay very pleasant, and the
exquisite pain of a good scratching
was one of the finest pleasures
he knew. So, whatever his motive,
the result was the same: the signs
were renewed each spring.</p>

<p>At length the Palette Ranch outfit
appeared on the Lower Piney,
and the men got acquainted with
the "ugly old fellow." The Cow-punchers,
when they saw him, decided
they "hadn't lost any Bears
and they had better keep out of his
way and let him mind his business."</p>

<p>They did not often see him, although
his tracks and sign-boards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
were everywhere. But the owner
of this outfit, a born hunter, took a
keen interest in Wahb. He learned
something of the old Bear's history
from Colonel Pickett, and
found out for himself more than
the colonel ever knew.</p>

<p>He learned that Wahb ranged
as far south as the Upper Wiggins
Fork and north to the Stinking
Water, and from the Meteetsee to
the Shoshones.</p>

<p>He found that Wahb knew more
about Bear-traps than most trappers
do; that he either passed them
by or tore open the other end of the
bait-pen and dragged out the bait
without going near the trap, and
by accident or design Wahb sometimes
sprang the trap with one of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the logs that formed the pen. This
ranch-owner found also that Wahb
disappeared from his range each
year during the heat of the summer,
as completely as he did each winter
during his sleep.</p>

of wildlife forever. In the
limits of this great Wonderland the
ideal of the Royal Singer was to be
realized, and none were to harm or
make afraid. No violence was to
be offered to any bird or beast, no
ax was to be carried into its primitive
forests, and the streams were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

fear nor attack him, and they are

The Bears are especially numerous
about the Fountain Hotel.
In the woods, a quarter of a
mile away, is a smooth open place
where the steward of the hotel has
all the broken and waste food put
out daily for the Bears, and the man
whose work it is has become the
Steward of the Bears' Banquet.
Each day it is spread, and each
year there are more Bears to partake
of it. It is a common thing
now to see a dozen Bears feasting
there at one time. They are
of all kinds&mdash;Black, Brown, Cinnamon,
Grizzly, Silvertip, Roachbacks,
big and small, families and
rangers, from all parts of the vast
surrounding country. All seem to
realize that in the Park no violence
is allowed, and the most ferocious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
of them have here put on
a new behavior. Although scores
of Bears roam about this choice resort,
and sometimes quarrel among
themselves, not one of them has
ever yet harmed a man.</p>

<p>Year after year they have come
and gone. The passing travellers
see them. The men of the hotel
know many of them well. They
know that they show up each summer
during the short season when
the hotel is in use, and that they
disappear again, no man knowing
whence they come or whither they
go.</p>

<p>One day the owner of the Palette
Ranch came through the Park.
During his stay at the Fountain
Hotel, he went to the Bear Banquet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
Hall at high meal-tide. There
were several Blackbears feasting,
but they made way for a huge
Silvertip Grizzly that came about
sundown.</p>

<p>"That," said the man who was
acting as guide, "is the biggest
Grizzly in the Park; but he is a
peaceable sort, or Lud knows
what'd happen."</p>

<p>"That!" said the ranchman, in
astonishment, as the Grizzly came
hulking nearer, and loomed up like
a load of hay among the piney
pillars of the Banquet Hall. "That!
If that is not Meteetsee Wahb, I
never saw a Bear in my life! Why,
that is the worst Grizzly that ever
rolled a log in the Big Horn
Basin."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
"It ain't possible," said the
other, "for he's here every summer,
July and August, an' I reckon
he don't live so far away."</p>

<p>"Well, that settles it," said the
ranchman; "July and August is
just the time we miss him on the
range; and you can see for yourself
that he is a little lame behind and
has lost a claw of his left front foot.
Now I know where he puts in
his summers; but I did not suppose
that the old reprobate would
know enough to behave himself
away from home."</p>

<p>The big Grizzly became very
well known during the successive
hotel seasons. Once only did he
really behave ill, and that was the
first season he appeared, before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
he fully knew the ways of the
Park.</p>

<p>He wandered over to the hotel,
one day, and in at the front door.
In the hall he reared up his eight
feet of stature as the guests fled in
terror; then he went into the clerk's
office. The man said: "All right;
if you need this office more than I
do, you can have it," and leaping
over the counter, locked himself in
the telegraph-office to wire the
superintendent of the Park: "Old
Grizzly in the office now, seems
to want to run hotel; may we
shoot?"</p>

<p>The reply came: "No shooting
allowed in Park; use the hose."
Which they did, and, wholly taken
by surprise, the Bear leaped over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
the counter too, and ambled out
the back way, with a heavy <i>thud-thudding</i>
of his feet, and a rattling
of his claws on the floor. He
passed through the kitchen as he
went, and, picking up a quarter of
beef, took it along.</p>

<p>This was the only time he was
known to do ill, though on one occasion
he was led into a breach
of the peace by another Bear.
This was a large she-Blackbear
and a noted mischief-maker. She
had a wretched, sickly cub that
she was very proud of&mdash;so proud
that she went out of her way to
seek trouble on his behalf. And
he, like all spoiled children, was
the cause of much bad feeling.
She was so big and fierce that she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
could bully all the other Blackbears,
but when she tried to drive
off old Wahb she received a pat
from his paw that sent her tumbling
like a football. He followed her
up, and would have killed her, for
she had broken the peace of the
Park, but she escaped by climbing
a tree, from the top of which her
miserable little cub was apprehensively
squealing at the pitch of his
voice. So the affair was ended; in
future the Blackbear kept out of
Wahb's way, and he won the reputation
of being a peaceable, well-behaved
Bear. Most persons believed
that he came from some
remote mountains where were
neither guns nor traps to make
him sullen and revengeful.</p>

<p><img class="initial" src="images/initial_e.png" alt="" title="" /><span class="smcap">very</span> one knows
that a Bitter-root
Grizzly is a bad
Bear. The Bitter-root
Range is the
roughest part of the mountains.
The ground is everywhere cut up
with deep ravines and overgrown
with dense and tangled underbrush.</p>

<p>It is an impossible country for
horses, and difficult for gunners,
and there is any amount of good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Bear-pasture. So there are plenty
of Bears and plenty of trappers.</p>

<p>The Roachbacks, as the Bitter-root
Grizzlies are called, are a
cunning and desperate race. An
old Roachback knows more about
traps than half a dozen ordinary
trappers; he knows more about
plants and roots than a whole college
of botanists. He can tell to a
certainty just when and where to
find each kind of grub and worm,
and he knows by a whiff whether
the hunter on his trail a mile away
is working with guns, poison, dogs,
traps, or all of them together. And
he has one general rule, which is
an endless puzzle to the hunter:
"Whatever you decide to do, do it
quickly and follow it right up." So
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
when a trapper and a Roachback
meet, the Bear at once makes up
his mind to run away as hard as he
can, or to rush at the man and
fight to a finish.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i135.png" width="300" height="172" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Grizzlies of the Bad Lands
did not do this: they used to stand
on their dignity and growl like a
thunder-storm, and so gave the
hunters a chance to play their
deadly lightning; and lightning is
worse than thunder any day. Men
can get used to growls that rumble
along the ground and up one's legs
to the little house where one's
courage lives; but Bears cannot
get used to 45&ndash;90 soft-nosed bullets,
and that is why the Grizzlies
of the Bad Lands were all killed
off.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i137.png" width="160" height="287" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
So the hunters have learned
that they never know what a
Roachback will do; but they do
know that he is going to be quick
about it.</p>

<p>Altogether these Bitter-root
Grizzlies have solved very well
the problem of life, in spite of
white men, and are therefore increasing
in their own wild mountains.</p>

<p>Of course a range will hold only
so many Bears, and the increase
is crowded out; so that when that
slim young Bald-faced Roachback
found he could not hold the range
he wanted, he went out perforce to
seek his fortune in the world.</p>

<p>He was not a big Bear, or he
would not have been crowded out;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
but he had been trained in a good
school, so that he was cunning
enough to get on very well elsewhere.
How he wandered down
to the Salmon River Mountains
and did not like them; how he
traveled till he got among the barbwire
fences of the Snake Plains
and of course could not stay there;
how a mere chance turned him
from going eastward to the Park,
where he might have rested; how
he made for the Snake River
Mountains and found more hunters
than berries; how he crossed into
the Tetons and looked down with
disgust on the teeming man colony
of Jackson's Hole, does not belong
to this history of Wahb. But when
Baldy Roachback crossed the Gros
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Ventre Range and over the Wind
River Divide to the head of the
Graybull, he does come into the
story, just as he did into the country
and the life of the Meteetsee
Grizzly.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i140.png" width="120" height="161" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The Roachback had not found
a man-sign since he left Jackson's
Hole, and here he was in a land of
plenty of food. He feasted on all
the delicacies of the season, and
enjoyed the easy, brushless country
till he came on one of Wahb's
sign-posts.</p>

<p>"Trespassers beware!" it said
in the plainest manner. The
Roachback reared up against it.</p>

<p>"Thunder! what a Bear!" The
nose-mark was a head and neck
above Baldy's highest reach. Now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a simple Bear would have gone
quietly away after this discovery;
but Baldy felt that the mountains
owed him a living, and here was a
good one if he could keep out of
the way of the big fellow. He
nosed about the place, kept a sharp
lookout for the present owner, and
went on feeding wherever he ran
across a good thing.</p>

<p>A step or two from this ominous
tree was an old pine stump. In the
Bitter-roots there are often mice-nests
under such stumps, and
Baldy jerked it over to see. There
was nothing. The stump rolled
over against the sign-post. Baldy
had not yet made up his mind
about it; but a new notion came
into his cunning brain. He turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
his head on this side, then on that.
He looked at the stump, then at
the sign, with his little pig-like
eyes. Then he deliberately stood
up on the pine root, with his back
to the tree, and put his mark away
up, a head at least above that of
Wahb. He rubbed his back long
and hard, and he sought some
mud to smear his head and shoulders,
then came back and made the
mark so big, so strong, and so
high, and emphasized it with such
claw-gashes in the bark, that it
could be read only in one way&mdash;a
challenge to the present claimant
from some monstrous invader, who
was ready, nay anxious, to fight to
a finish for this desirable range.</p>

<p class="caption center">"HE DELIBERATELY STOOD UP ON THE PINE ROOT."</p>
</div>

<p>Maybe it was accident and maybe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
design, but when the Roachback
jumped from the root it rolled
to one side. Baldy went on down
the ca&ntilde;on, keeping the keenest
lookout for his enemy.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 100px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i145.png" width="100" height="253" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>It was not long before Wahb
found the trail of the interloper,
and all the ferocity of his outside-the-Park
nature was aroused.</p>

<p>He followed the trail for miles
on more than one occasion. But
the small Bear was quick-footed as
well as quick-witted, and never
showed himself. He made a point,
however, of calling at each sign-post,
and if there was any means
of cheating, so that his mark might
be put higher, he did it with a vim,
and left a big, showy record. But
if there was no chance for any but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
a fair register, he would not go
near the tree, but looked for a fresh
tree near by with some log or side-ledge
to reach from.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i146.png" width="80" height="196" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Thus Wahb soon found the interloper's
marks towering far above
his own&mdash;a monstrous Bear evidently,
that even he could not be
sure of mastering. But Wahb was
no coward. He was ready to fight
to a finish anyone that might
come; and he hunted the range for
that invader. Day after day Wahb
sought for him and held himself
ready to fight. He found his trail
daily, and more and more often he
found that towering record far
above his own. He often smelled
him on the wind; but he never saw
him, for the old Grizzly's eyes had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
grown very dim of late years;
things but a little way off were
mere blurs to him. The continual
menace could not but fill Wahb
with uneasiness, for he was not
young now, and his teeth and claws
were worn and blunted. He was
more than ever troubled with pains
in his old wounds, and though he
could have risen on the spur of the
moment to fight any number of
Grizzlies of any size, still the continual
apprehension, the knowledge
that he must hold himself ready at
any moment to fight this young
monster, weighed on his spirits and
began to tell on his general health.</p>

was one of continual
vigilance, always
ready to run, doubling
and shifting to
avoid the encounter that must mean
instant death to him. Many a time
from some hiding-place he watched
the great Bear, and trembled lest
the wind should betray him. Several
times his very impudence
saved him, and more than once he
was nearly cornered in a box-ca&ntilde;on.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Once he escaped only by
climbing up a long crack in a cliff,
which Wahb's huge frame could
not have entered. But still, in a
mad persistence, he kept on marking
the trees farther into the range.</p>

<p>At last he scented and followed
up the sulphur-bath. He did not
understand it at all. It had no appeal
to him, but hereabouts were
the tracks of the owner. In a
spirit of mischief the Roachback
scratched dirt into the spring, and
then seeing the rubbing-tree, he
stood sidewise on the rocky ledge,
and was thus able to put his mark
fully five feet above that of Wahb.
Then he nervously jumped down,
and was running about, defiling the
bath and keeping a sharp lookout,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
when he heard a noise in the
woods below. Instantly he was all
alert. The sound drew near, then
the wind brought the sure proof,
and the Roachback, in terror,
turned and fled into the woods.</p>

<p>It was Wahb. He had been
failing in health of late; his old
pains were on him again, and, as
well as his hind leg, had seized his
right shoulder, where were still
lodged two rifle-balls. He was
feeling very ill, and crippled with
pain. He came up the familiar
bank at a jerky limp, and there
caught the odor of the foe; then
he saw the track in the mud&mdash;his
eyes said the track of a <i>small</i> Bear,
but his eyes were dim now, and
his nose, his unerring nose, said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
"This is the track of the huge invader."
Then he noticed the tree
with his sign on it, and there beyond
doubt was the stranger's mark
far above his own. His eyes and
nose were agreed on this; and
more, they told him that the foe
was close at hand, might at any
moment come.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 80px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i153.png" width="80" height="354" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Wahb was feeling ill and weak
with pain. He was in no mood for
a desperate fight. A battle against
such odds would be madness now.
So, without taking the treatment,
he turned and swung along the
bench away from the direction
taken by the stranger&mdash;the first
time since his cubhood that he
had declined to fight.</p>

<p>That was a turning-point in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Wahb's life. If he had followed
up the stranger he would have
found the miserable little craven
trembling, cowering, in an agony
of terror, behind a log in a natural
trap, a walled-in glade only fifty
yards away, and would surely have
crushed him. Had he even taken
the bath, his strength and courage
would have been renewed, and if
not, then at least in time he would
have met his foe, and his after life
would have been different. But he
had turned. This was the fork in
the trail, but he had no means of
knowing it.</p>

<p>He limped along, skirting the
lower spurs of the Shoshones, and
soon came on that horrid smell
that he had known for years, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
never followed up or understood.
It was right in his road, and he
traced it to a small, barren ravine
that was strewn over with skeletons
and dark objects, and Wahb,
as he passed, smelled a smell of
many different animals, and knew
by its quality that they were lying
dead in this treeless, grassless hollow.
For there was a cleft in the
rocks at the upper end, whence
poured a deadly gas; invisible but
heavy, it filled the little gulch like
a brimming poison bowl, and at the
lower end there was a steady overflow.
But Wahb knew only that
the air that poured from it as he
passed made him dizzy and sleepy,
and repelled him, so that he got
quickly away from it and was glad
once more to breathe the piny wind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
Once Wahb decided to retreat,
it was all too easy to do so next
time; and the result worked double
disaster. For, since the big stranger
was allowed possession of the sulphur-spring,
Wahb felt that he
would rather not go there. Sometimes
when he came across the
traces of his foe, a spurt of his old
courage would come back. He
would rumble that thunder-growl
as of old, and go painfully lumbering
along the trail to settle the thing
right then and there. But he never
overtook the mysterious giant, and
his rheumatism, growing worse
now that he was barred from the
cure, soon made him daily less
capable of either running or fighting.</p>

<p>Sometimes Wahb would sense
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
his foe's approach when he was
in a bad place for fighting, and,
without really running, he would
yield to a wish to be on a better
footing, where he would have a
fair chance. This better footing
never led him nearer the enemy,
for it is well known that the one
awaiting has the advantage.</p>

<p>Some days Wahb felt so ill that
it would have been madness to have
staked everything on a fight, and
when he felt well or a little better,
the stranger seemed to keep away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i156.png" width="300" height="78" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 160px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i157.png" width="160" height="280" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Wahb soon found that the stranger's
track was most often on the
Warhouse and the west slope of
the Piney, the very best feeding-grounds.
To avoid these when he
did not feel equal to fighting was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
only natural, and as he was always
in more or less pain now, it amounted
to abandoning to the stranger
the best part of the range.</p>

<p>Weeks went by. Wahb had
meant to go back to his bath, but
he never did. His pains grew
worse; he was now crippled in his
right shoulder as well as in his
hind leg.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 160px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i159.png" width="160" height="249" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>The long strain of waiting for
the fight begot anxiety, that grew
to be apprehension, which, with
the sapping of his strength, was
breaking down his courage, as it
always must when courage is
founded on muscular force. His
daily care now was not to meet and
fight the invader, but to avoid him
till he felt better.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Thus that first little retreat grew
into one long retreat. Wahb had
to go farther and farther down the
Piney to avoid an encounter. He
was daily worse fed, and as the
weeks went by was daily less able
to crush a foe.</p>

<p>He was living and hiding at last
on the Lower Piney&mdash;the very
place where once his Mother had
brought him with his little brothers.
The life he led now was much like
the one he had led after that dark
day. Perhaps for the same reason.
If he had had a family of his own
all might have been different. As
he limped along one morning, seeking
among the barren aspen groves
for a few roots, or the wormy
partridge-berries that were too poor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
to interest the Squirrel and the
Grouse, he heard a stone rattle
down the western slope into the
woods, and, a little later, on the
wind was borne the dreaded taint.
He waded through the ice-cold
Piney,&mdash;once he would have leaped
it,&mdash;and the chill water sent through
and up each great hairy limb keen
pains that seemed to reach his very
life. He was retreating again&mdash;which
way? There seemed but
one way now&mdash;toward the new
ranch-house.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i160.png" width="120" height="213" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>But there were signs of stir
about it long before he was near
enough to be seen. His nose, his
trustiest friend, said, "Turn, turn
and seek the hills," and turn he did
even at the risk of meeting there
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
the dreadful foe. He limped painfully
along the north bank of the
Piney, keeping in the hollows and
among the trees. He tried to climb
a cliff that of old he had often
bounded up at full speed. When
half-way up his footing gave way,
and down he rolled to the bottom.
A long way round was now the only
road, for onward he must go&mdash;on&mdash;on.
But where? There seemed
no choice now but to abandon the
whole range to the terrible stranger.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 120px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i162.png" width="120" height="161" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>And feeling, as far as a Bear can
feel, that he is fallen, defeated, dethroned
at last, that he is driven
from his ancient range by a Bear
too strong for him to face, he turned
up the west fork, and the lot was
drawn. The strength and speed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
were gone from his once mighty
limbs; he took three times as long
as he once would to mount each
well-known ridge, and as he went
he glanced backward from time to
time to know if he were pursued.
Away up the head of the little
branch were the Shoshones, bleak,
forbidding; no enemies were there,
and the Park was beyond it all&mdash;on,
on he must go. But as he
climbed with shaky limbs, and
short uncertain steps, the west wind
brought the odor of Death Gulch,
that fearful little valley where everything
was dead, where the very air
was deadly. It used to disgust him
and drive him away, but now Wahb
felt that it had a message for him;
he was drawn by it. It was in his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
line of flight, and he hobbled slowly
toward the place. He went nearer,
nearer, until he stood upon the
entering ledge. A Vulture that had
descended to feed on one of the
victims was slowly going to sleep
on the untouched carcass. Wahb
swung his great grizzled muzzle
and his long white beard in the
wind. The odor that he once had
hated was attractive now. There
was a strange biting quality in the
air. His body craved it. For it
seemed to numb his pain and it
promised sleep, as it did that day
when first he saw the place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 240px;">
<img class="plain" src="images/i161.png" width="240" height="393" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Far below him, to the right and
to the left and on and on as far as
the eye could reach, was the great
kingdom that once had been his:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
where he had lived for years in the
glory of his strength; where none
had dared to meet him face to face.
The whole earth could show no
view more beautiful. But Wahb
had no thought of its beauty; he
only knew that it was a good land
to live in; that it had been his, but
that now it was gone, for his
strength was gone, and he was flying
to seek a place where he could
rest and be at peace.</p>

<p>Away over the Shoshones, indeed,
was the road to the Park,
but it was far, far away, with a
doubtful end to the long, doubtful
journey. But why so far? Here in
this little gulch was all he sought;
here were peace and painless sleep.
He knew it; for his nose, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
never-erring nose, said, "<i>Here!
here now!</i>"</p>

<p>He paused a moment at the gate,
and as he stood the wind-borne
fumes began their subtle work.
Five were the faithful wardens of
his life, and the best and trustiest
of them all flung open wide the
door he long had kept. A moment
still Wahb stood in doubt. His
lifelong guide was silent now, had
given up his post. But another
sense he felt within. The Angel of
the Wild Things was standing
there, beckoning, in the little vale.
Wahb did not understand. He had
no eyes to see the tear in the
Angel's eyes, nor the pitying smile
that was surely on his lips. He
could not even see the Angel. But
he <i>felt</i> him beckoning, beckoning.</p>

A rush of his ancient courage
surged in the Grizzly's rugged
breast. He turned aside into the
little gulch. The deadly vapors
entered in, filled his huge chest
and tingled in his vast, heroic
limbs as he calmly lay down on the
rocky, herbless floor and as gently
went to sleep, as he did that day in
his Mother's arms by the Graybull,
long ago.</p>
